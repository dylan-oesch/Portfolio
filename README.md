# Portfolio
Personal portfolio of projects.
Welcome to my personal portfolio!  
This repository serves as a central hub linking to the engineering and software projects I’ve built.

Each project below includes:
- A detailed README  
- Source code  
- Schematics / simulations  
- Screenshots and documentation

## 🔧 Digital Logic & FPGA Projects

### **Serial Sequence Detector (ECE 2277)**
A hardware-implemented Moore FSM on the Intel DE10-Lite FPGA that detects 4-bit sequences derived from my student number using Gray code state assignment.  
Includes full Verilog implementation, Quartus schematics, simulation waveforms, and project documentation.

## 💻 Software Development Projects
### **Airplane-Boarding-System (SE2205)**
This project is an interactive Airplane Boarding and Disembarking System built using Java and core data structures. It simulates real-world airline operations by using a queue for check-in, an ArrayList seat map for boarding passengers back-to-front, and a stack for disembarking them front-to-back. The system includes a user-friendly console interface that allows adding, removing, boarding, and offloading passengers while dynamically updating the aircraft’s seating layout.
